## Project analysis:

### Target user

This project's final user will be the Human Resources Department of the comany I'll be aplying. So, it must be serious but no too formal.

### Information architecture

I'll be dividing the different sections of my curriculum (personal information, previous experience, studies, other abilities...) in foldable tabs, inspired by come web's FAQs section.

### Visual design

I'm going for a basic blue palette and typography family on the style of Verdana for the main text and courier monospace for the title
